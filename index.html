				<!-- brief -->
				<p class="brief">The Himalayan Cat is a sweet and mild-tempered feline. She’s affectionate but
					selective.
					Although she loves lying in your lap and being pet, she may be reserved around guests. Serene, quiet
					environments with few day-to-day changes are best for the Himmie.</p>

				<!-- detailed guide -->
				<p class="detailed-guide">Aside from her colorpoint and eye color, she resembles the Persian in nearly
					every
					other way. Himalayans have a large, round head with wide-set, round eyes, a short nose and full
					cheeks.
					Her face is topped with small, round-tipped ears. Himalayans are not fat cats, but instead have a
					sturdy, muscular body with a thick neck and short, strong legs.</p>
